        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is <strong>Ineza Bonté Grévy</strong>. I come from Kigali which is the capital city of Rwanda. I am currently pursuing Software Engineering at the <strong>Adventist University Of Central Africa</strong> which I started this year back in January. <br>
        I developed interest for technology at a young age while I was still In high school. I was amazed by how much one can do with simple lines of code on the computer and that intrigued me to start learning to code right away. My journey of learning to code hasn't been as easy as I expected but I was encouranged to keep learning and pushing. I see technology as a future way to power and drive our daily lives.  <br>
        Rwanda otherwise known as <em>the land of a thousand hills</em> has taken major steps in becoming the hub of technolgy and innovation in Central Africa which has encouraged many youth to engage themselves and aquire some valuable skills. I am quite confident that the skills I will aquire from my studies will empower me to create amazing products for my country and also push forward innnovation at a higher level. 
        </p>
